# COMM4190 Spring 2024 - Research Project

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to determine how effective ChatGPT could be in emotionally charged communication scenarios. In particular, I wanted to explore how ChatGPT would respond to a breakup. Breakups are unique communication scenarios in that they involve significant emotionality and can play out in numerous different ways. Through this project, I will explore whether ChatGPT can mimic the numerous ways that humans interact with people toward whos they have both affection, as well as pain or resentment.

To accomplish this, I will utilize both academic research, as well as conducting field research using ChatGPT to act out a number of live scenarios.

## Methodology

1. Conduct academic research
2. Using academic research, develop set of scenarios to conduct with ChatGPT
3. Run through each communication scenario with ChatGPT and record each conversation trasncript
4. Use transcript to inform paper content
